Name: Jonathan Butler
Project: Programming in C

This program reads in a data.txt file; which can be designated by a user entered path, or by a pre-programed path (currectly pre-programed). this data file is then converted into an int array, and then seperated into 2 matrixes. Matrix A is 5*x and Matrix B is x*5 with x bring the total number of integers divided by 2, then divided by 5. the program then writes these matrixes to an output.txt file (which loction is currectly pre-programed in); if the file exists it will be overwritten, if it does not exist the file will be created. The program then multiplys Matrix A and Matrix B and creates Matrix C; which is also written to the output file.
